'''
Docstring for app.routers
This folder answers:

“What can the outside world do with this system?”

Each file groups related endpoints.

Example:
health.py → system status
jobs.py → job management
auth.py → login, users

Why folder?
APIs grow fast
Grouping prevents chaos

Think:
“One router = one responsibility”
